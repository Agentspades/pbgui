    assigned_balance overriding balance fetched from exchange
    On spot market it is recommended to fix wallet balance to a given value.
    This because in spot trading there are no positions, no wallet balance
    and no unrealized PnL. There is only plain buy and sell.
    So wallet balance and position must be simulated by looking in past user
    trade history.

    only create limit orders closer to price than threshold. default=0.5 (50%)
    The grid is exactly the same it just does not place the buy/sell orders
    which are far away from the current price. When the price moves in that
    direction and gets into the threshold's % range it will place those orders too.

    p (panic): bot will close positions asap using limit orders
    t (TP-only): bot only manages TP grid and will not cancel
       or create any entries.

    On futures markets with leverage, passivbot may expose more than 100%
    of the wallet's funds. Passivbot uses only (unleveraged) wallet balance
    in its calculations, so adjusting leverage on exchange will make
    no difference on risk, profit or bot behavior, as long as leverage is set
    high enough for the bot to make its grid according to the configuration.
